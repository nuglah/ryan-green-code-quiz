# Code-Quiz

## Description

Made a short multiple choice quiz using mostly javascript. The challenge was good practice using javascript to dynamically place items on a page. Also the use of multiple javscript skills like intervals for the time and multiple on click events. Finally the challenge used local storage for the storage of high scores.
